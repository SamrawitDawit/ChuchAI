ChuchAI is an educational chatbot designed to engage children in interactive learning sessions, improving their literacy and numeracy skills. This chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to offer two main features:

Storytelling: it can tell simple, engaging stories.
Math Practice: it provides simple math problems to help children practice addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in an interactive way.

Technologies Used
NLP: Most of the part is key word matching and we also used regex(regular expression) and spaCy.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and interactive user interface.
Backend: Python with Flask for server-side logic.
